# SurePetcare Feeder Connect Repair Guide

## Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive repair guide for the **SurePetcare Feeder Connect**, addressing a common failure mode where the **lid fails to open**, even though the motor remains active and produces sound.
In my experience, this issue affected two separate units after approximately **4 years of use**, and both failures occurred **shortly after a battery replacement**. Before the feeders stopped functioning entirely, they exhibited loud and irregular noises from the gearbox—symptoms consistent with internal mechanical wear or gear damage.
This guide includes **step-by-step repair instructions with photos**, outlining the full disassembly process and identifying the components that typically require replacement.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning the repair, you’ll need the following tools and materials:

- Drill bits: 1.5mm and 2mm (suitable for plastic)
- Replacement gear with the following specifications:
  - Teeth: 12  
  - Module: 0.3  
  - Outer diameter: 4.2mm  
  - Inner diameter: 2.0mm
- Silicone grease (recommended for lubricating plastic gears)

## Gear Substitution

An exact replacement for the original gear could not be sourced. However, the following alternative gear was used successfully:

- Teeth: 12  
- Module: 0.3  
- Outer diameter: 4.2mm  
- Inner diameter: 1.15mm

> **Note:** While the inner diameter is smaller than required, the gear can be modified to fit the motor shaft using methods such as precision drilling or by inserting a sleeve adapter to ensure a secure fit.

## Root Cause of the Failure

The issue appears to stem from wear and misalignment in the smallest gear within the gearbox. Over time, this gear becomes worn down and begins to slip or misalign with the adjacent larger gear. This misalignment leads to mechanical resistance, ultimately causing the motor to stall while still producing sound.

As shown in the second image below, the gear also developed a visible crack, which likely contributes to the malfunction. The crack may allow the gear to shift under load or deform slightly, causing it to jam or skip teeth and preventing the lid from opening correctly.

## Disassembly and Repair Steps

### 1. **Remove the Lid and Open the Feeder**

Start by removing the lid. You will need to unscrew the **4 screws** (highlighted in **red**) that secure the lid in place.

### 2. **Disconnect the Button Circuit**

Next, remove the circuit for the buttons (highlighted in **red**). Unscrew the **4 screws** (highlighted in **blue**) to release the lid mechanism.

### 3. **Remove the Gearbox**

To access the gearbox, unscrew the **3 screws** (highlighted in **red**) securing the gearbox, as well as **1 screw** (highlighted in **green**) holding the flap in place.

If possible, remove the **green nut**, but if it's difficult, it can be removed in a later step. Be careful when removing the gearbox, as the cables are fragile. You may also need to manually rotate the extension (held by the **blue nut**) to free the gearbox from the frame.

### 4. **Remove Additional Screws to Access the Gearbox**

Next, remove the **3 screws** (highlighted in **red**) to access the gearbox.

### 5. **Rotate the Lid and Access the Gear**

Rotate the lid to access the gear. This step requires care, and it's crucial to have a clean workspace to prevent dust or foreign objects from entering the gearbox. 

Pay attention to the placement of each gear, as they may fall out when you remove the lid. The gear to replace is the **black gear**—originally, it is white. Use a flathead screwdriver to carefully pop out the worn-out gear.

As you can see, the replacement gear I used had a smaller inner diameter than required. I had to carefully drill the hole to approximately **2mm** to match the motor shaft. 
The gear should fit snugly—tight enough to stay fixed during operation, but not so tight that it requires excessive force, which could cause it to crack. If the hole is too large, the gear may spin freely without engaging the shaft, in which case it won’t function correctly and will need to be replaced.

### 6. **Apply Silicone Grease**

Once the gear is replaced, apply a small amount of **silicone grease** to the new gear to ensure smooth operation and reduce wear.

### 7. **Reassemble the Feeder**

After applying the grease, follow the disassembly steps in reverse to reassemble the feeder. Ensure everything is securely fastened.

### 8. **Test the Product**

After reassembly, power on the feeder and test it to ensure the motor operates correctly and the lid opens and closes smoothly.

You're all done! If you encounter any issues, feel free to revisit the steps to double-check the assembly or gear replacement process.
